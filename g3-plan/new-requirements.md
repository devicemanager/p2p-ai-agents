In planning mode, please first read the requirements documents in the docs folder.
Make sure the requirements are understood, and if not try to find the higher level requirements.
From this create new requirements descriptions, outlining detailed specifications of lower level requirements.
Each requirement file should preferably be as short as possible and contain a testable description.
Write tests that are proving the description of the requirements.
Be critical on both requirements and implementations. If something doesn't sound right, reconsider.
