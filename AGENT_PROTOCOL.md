# AGENT_PROTOCOL.md

## Overview
This document describes the protocol used by agents in the p2p-ai-agents network to communicate, distribute tasks, and share results.

## Agent Discovery
- Agents use a P2P protocol (e.g., libp2p) for peer discovery.
- Each agent advertises its capabilities and status.

## Task Distribution
- Tasks are chunked and distributed to available peers.
- Each task includes metadata: type, data reference, priority, and required resources.
- Agents can accept, reject, or delegate tasks.

## Data Exchange
- Data is exchanged using secure, encrypted channels.
- Agents may use IPFS or similar for large data blobs.

## Result Aggregation
- Results are sent back to the originating agent.
- Aggregation strategies may include voting, averaging, or custom logic.

## Security
- All communications are authenticated and encrypted.
- Agents verify the integrity of received data and results.

## Extensibility
- Protocol supports versioning for backward compatibility.
- New task types and capabilities can be added via protocol extensions.

## MVP Peer-to-Peer Protocol Considerations

- **Security & Authentication:** Agents must sign all protocol messages and use encrypted channels.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Protocol should support heartbeat, peer failure detection, and task reassignment.
- **Message/Task Format:** All protocol messages are JSON with type, task_id, payload, sender_id, and signature.
- **Network Bootstrap:** Agents join via bootstrap node or multicast, then discover more peers.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Agents should log protocol events and errors for audit and debugging.

This protocol is a living document and will evolve as the project grows.
