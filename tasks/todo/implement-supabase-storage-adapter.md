# Task: Implement Supabase Storage Adapter

## Objective
Implement a Supabase storage adapter that integrates with the existing storage layer architecture to provide cloud-based storage capabilities with documentation and unit tests.

## Description
This task focuses on creating a new storage adapter that leverages Supabase's PostgreSQL database to provide a cloud-based storage solution for the P2P AI agents system. The adapter should implement the existing storage traits and provide comprehensive documentation and unit test coverage.

## Requirements

### Core Storage Adapter Implementation
- [ ] Implement `StorageLayer` trait for Supabase integration
- [ ] Create `SupabaseStorageAdapter` struct with configuration
- [ ] Add async CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- [ ] Implement batch operations for efficient data handling
- [ ] Add connection pooling and retry mechanisms

### Supabase Integration Features
- [ ] Configure Supabase client with connection settings
- [ ] Add real-time subscriptions for data changes
- [ ] Support for JSON document storage and querying
- [ ] Implement file storage integration (Supabase Storage)
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for all operations

### Configuration and Setup
- [ ] Add Supabase configuration options to storage config
- [ ] Environment variable support for connection strings
- [ ] Database schema initialization and migrations
- [ ] Connection health checks and monitoring
- [ ] Add usage documentation and examples

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Adapter Structure
1. Create `SupabaseStorageAdapter` struct in `src/storage/supabase.rs`
2. Add Supabase client dependencies to `Cargo.toml`
3. Implement basic CRUD operations
4. Add configuration structure and environment setup

### Phase 2: Storage Trait Implementation
1. Implement `StorageLayer` trait for the adapter
2. Add async support for all storage operations
3. Implement error handling and result types
4. Add unit tests for basic functionality

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Implement real-time subscriptions
2. Add batch operations and transactions
3. Integrate file storage capabilities
4. Add performance optimizations and caching

### Phase 4: Testing and Documentation
1. Create comprehensive unit tests
2. Add integration tests with test database
3. Write usage documentation and examples
4. Add performance benchmarks

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
```toml
[dependencies]
supabase-rs = "0.4"
postgrest = "1.0"
tokio-postgres = "0.7"
serde_json = "1.0"
uuid = "1.0"
```

### Configuration Structure
```rust
pub struct SupabaseConfig {
    pub url: String,
    pub anon_key: String,
    pub service_role_key: Option<String>,
    pub schema: String,
    pub max_connections: u32,
    pub connection_timeout: Duration,
}
```

### Database Schema
- Create tables for key-value storage
- Add indexes for optimal query performance
- Implement RLS policies for security
- Support for JSON document storage

## Expected Outcomes
- Fully functional Supabase storage adapter
- Real-time data synchronization capabilities
- Cloud-based storage solution for distributed agents
- Comprehensive test coverage and documentation
- Performance benchmarks and optimization guidelines

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] All storage trait methods implemented and tested
- [ ] Real-time subscriptions working correctly
- [ ] Security policies properly configured
- [ ] Performance meets or exceeds local storage benchmarks
- [ ] Documentation complete with usage examples
- [ ] Integration tests pass with live Supabase instance

## Technical Notes
- Use async/await throughout for non-blocking operations
- Implement proper connection lifecycle management
- Add comprehensive error handling for network issues
- Support both development and production configurations
- Consider data migration strategies from other storage adapters

## Dependencies
- Existing storage layer architecture
- Supabase account and project setup
- Network connectivity for cloud operations
- PostgreSQL knowledge for schema design

## Priority
Medium - Adds valuable cloud storage capabilities

## Component
- Storage Layer
- Cloud Integration
- Real-time Features

## Estimated Effort
High (8-12 hours) - Complex integration with external service

## Related Tasks
- Storage layer performance optimization
- Real-time event system implementation
- Authentication and security enhancements
