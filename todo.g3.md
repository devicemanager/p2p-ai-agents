- [x] Handle Task: Decompose CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS into 4 parallelizable chunks
  - [x] Identify and locate the full CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS document (e.g., search for relevant files)
  - [x] Read and analyze the requirements content
  - [x] Break down the requirements into key components

- [ ] Implement CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS for Network Service
  - [x] Chunk 1: Foundation and Structure (Phases 1-2)
    - [x] Phase 1: Define Location of Network Service
      - [x] Determine the file and module structure for NetworkService (e.g., src/network/service.rs)
      - [x] Create the initial file structure
      - [x] Integrate with core service registry
    - [x] Phase 2: Define API for Network Service
      - [x] Define the NetworkService trait extending core::Service
