- [x] Acknowledge the feedback on script compatibility
- [x] Explain the issue with realpath on macOS
- [x] Confirm the Python script is cross-platform
- [x] Re-run the Python link checker to verify results
- [x] If any broken links found, fix them
- [x] Verify all links are valid
- [x] Provide detailed summary of verification process
- [x] Handle Task: Decompose CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS into 4 parallelizable chunks
  - [x] Identify and locate the full CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS document (e.g., search for relevant files)
  - [x] Read and analyze the requirements content
  - [x] Break down the requirements into key components
  - [x] Group components into exactly 4 non-overlapping, parallelizable chunks

- [ ] Implement CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS for Network Service
  - [x] Chunk 1: Foundation and Structure (Phases 1-2)
    - [x] Phase 1: Define Location of Network Service
      - [x] Determine the file and module structure for NetworkService (e.g., src/network/service.rs)
      - [x] Create the initial file structure
      - [x] Integrate with core service registry
    - [x] Phase 2: Define API for Network Service
      - [x] Define the NetworkService trait extending core::Service
      - [x] Specify required methods: initialize, start, stop, status, health, handle_request
      - [x] Define associated types: Config, Request, Response
