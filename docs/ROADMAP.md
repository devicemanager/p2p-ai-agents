# Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development phases for the Distributed Peer-to-Peer AI Agents project, aligned with our high-level design principles of decentralization, privacy-first, energy efficiency, scalability, interoperability, and security.

This roadmap now assumes a Rust implementation. All previous references to Python, pip, venv, and related setup have been removed. Please refer to the README for Rust setup instructions.
