# Task Management System

The P2P AI Agents project uses a Markdown-based task management system to track implementation progress. Tasks are automatically generated from implementation checklists and organized by status.

## Overview

- **Location**: `/tasks/` directory
- **Format**: Markdown files with standardized structure
- **Organization**: Tasks are organized into `todo/`, `in-progress/` and `completed/` directories
- **Automation**: Tasks are generated from implementation checklists and managed via scripts

## Directory Structure

```
tasks/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # Main index with task statistics
â”œâ”€â”€ todo/              # Tasks that haven't been started
â”œâ”€â”€ in-progress/       # Tasks currently being worked on
â””â”€â”€ completed/         # Finished and verified tasks
```

## Task Management Commands

### Quick Start

```bash
# Show help and available commands
./scripts/tasks.sh help

# Generate tasks from implementation checklists
./scripts/tasks.sh generate

# View task statistics
./scripts/tasks.sh stats

# List tasks by status
./scripts/tasks.sh list todo
./scripts/tasks.sh list in-progress
./scripts/tasks.sh list completed
```

### Working with Tasks

```bash
# Start working on a task
./scripts/tasks.sh start task-name.md

# Complete a task (with automatic commit and push)
./scripts/tasks.sh complete task-name.md

# Complete a task without auto-commit
./scripts/tasks.sh complete task-name.md --no-auto-commit

# Move task back to TODO
./scripts/tasks.sh todo task-name.md

# Search for specific tasks
./scripts/tasks.sh search "network manager"
./scripts/tasks.sh search "unit test"
```

### Manual Task Management

```bash
# Move task between statuses manually
./scripts/tasks.sh move task-name.md in-progress
./scripts/tasks.sh move task-name.md completed

# Update the main task index
./scripts/tasks.sh index
```

## Task File Format

Each task follows a standardized Markdown format:

```markdown
# Task Title

## Task Information
- Task ID, component, section, priority
- Status, creation date, source file

## Description
- Clear description of what needs to be done

## Acceptance Criteria
- Specific requirements that must be met

## Implementation Notes
- Technical details, design decisions

## Testing Strategy
- How the implementation will be tested

## Progress Log
- Timestamped updates and status changes

## Definition of Done
- Final checklist before completion
```

## Task Lifecycle

1. **Generation**: Tasks are automatically created from implementation checklists
2. **TODO**: Task is planned but not started
3. **In Progress**: Developer has started working on the task
4. **Completed**: Task is finished and meets all acceptance criteria

## Integration with Development Workflow

### From Implementation Checklists

Tasks are generated from structured checklists in the `docs/implementation/` directory:

```bash
# Generate tasks from latest checklist updates
./scripts/tasks.sh generate
```

### Status Updates

When working on tasks, update their status and add progress notes:

```bash
# Start working on a task
./scripts/tasks.sh start network-manager-implementation.md

# The task file will be updated with:
# - Status change to "IN PROGRESS"
# - Timestamp in progress log
# - Moved to in-progress/ directory
```

### Completion Tracking

When completing tasks:

```bash
# Mark task as completed
./scripts/tasks.sh complete network-manager-implementation.md
```

The system automatically:
- Updates task status
- Adds completion timestamp
- Moves file to completed/ directory
- Updates the main index with new statistics

## Task Statistics and Reporting

The system provides comprehensive progress tracking:

```bash
# View current statistics
./scripts/tasks.sh stats
```

Output example:
```
ðŸ“Š Task Statistics:
   Total: 352
   TODO: 300
   In Progress: 15
   Completed: 37
   Progress: 10.5%
```

## Task Index

The main task index (`tasks/README.md`) provides:

- Real-time task statistics
- Progress percentage
- Quick navigation to all tasks
- Management command examples
- Automatic updates when tasks change

## Advanced Features

### Search and Discovery

```bash
# Find tasks by keyword
./scripts/tasks.sh search "authentication"
./scripts/tasks.sh search "unit test"
./scripts/tasks.sh search "network"

# Search returns:
# - Matching task files
# - Current status
# - Preview of matching content
```

### Batch Operations

```bash
# Generate new tasks and update index
./scripts/tasks.sh generate

# Update statistics after manual changes
./scripts/tasks.sh index
```

### Integration with Development Tools

The task management system integrates with:

- **Git**: Task files are version controlled
- **Documentation**: Tasks link back to source documentation
- **CI/CD**: Task completion can trigger builds/tests
- **IDEs**: Markdown files work well with most editors

## Best Practices

### Task Naming

- Use descriptive, unique filenames
- Follow kebab-case convention
- Include component/area prefix when helpful

### Progress Tracking

- Update progress logs regularly
- Use timestamps for all status changes
- Document blockers and dependencies
- Link to related code changes

### Status Management

- Keep tasks in appropriate status directories
- Use the provided scripts rather than manual file moves
- Update task content when changing status
- Maintain the task index regularly

### Documentation Integration

- Keep task descriptions aligned with implementation docs
- Update acceptance criteria as requirements evolve
- Link tasks to related documentation sections
- Use tasks to track documentation updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tasks not appearing in lists:**
```bash
# Regenerate the index
./scripts/tasks.sh index
```

**Search not finding expected tasks:**
```bash
# Check task file locations
find tasks/ -name "*.md" | grep -i "search-term"
```

**Status changes not reflected:**
```bash
# Update the task index
./scripts/tasks.sh index
```

### Maintenance

```bash
# Clean up and regenerate all tasks
rm -rf tasks/todo/* tasks/in-progress/* tasks/completed/*
./scripts/tasks.sh generate

# Verify task integrity
./scripts/tasks.sh stats
./scripts/tasks.sh index
```

## Migration from GitHub Issues

This system replaces the GitHub Issues workflow for implementation tracking:

- **Better Integration**: Tasks stay with the code
- **Offline Access**: Work without internet connection
- **Version Control**: Full history of task changes
- **Customization**: Easily extend task format and workflow
- **Local Development**: Fast, responsive task management

The GitHub Issues workflow has been disabled and all existing issues have been converted to Markdown tasks.

## Automation Features

### Auto-Commit and Push

By default, when a task is moved to `completed` status, the system automatically:

1. **Commits changes** with a descriptive commit message
2. **Pushes to remote** repository (if configured)
3. **Updates task index** with latest statistics

This automation ensures that:
- Progress is immediately saved and backed up
- Git history maintains clear task completion records
- No manual commit steps are required

#### Auto-Commit Behavior

**Default (Auto-commit enabled):**
```bash
./scripts/tasks.sh complete my-task.md
# âœ… Completing task my-task.md...
# âœ… Moved my-task.md to completed  
# âœ… Committed changes for task: my-task.md
# ðŸš€ Pushed changes to remote repository
```

**With auto-commit disabled:**
```bash
./scripts/tasks.sh complete my-task.md --no-auto-commit
# âœ… Completing task my-task.md...
# âœ… Moved my-task.md to completed
# (No commit or push)
```

#### When to Use --no-auto-commit

- **Batch operations**: When completing multiple tasks
- **Testing**: When experimenting with task workflows  
- **Review first**: When you want to review changes before committing
- **Custom commits**: When you prefer to create your own commit messages
