# YOLO Mode Feature Specification

## Overview
YOLO (You Only Live Once) Mode is an advanced automation feature that enables rapid, autonomous task execution with built-in safety mechanisms.

## Goals
- Accelerate development by automating routine task workflows
- Maintain code quality through automated testing and validation
- Provide multiple escape valves for safety
- Enable efficient batch processing of related tasks

## Safety-First Design

### Core Principles
1. **Fail Fast**: Stop immediately on any anomaly
2. **Rollback Ready**: Every operation should be easily reversible
3. **Observable**: Full logging and progress tracking
4. **Bounded**: Clear limits on scope and impact
5. **Testable**: Automated validation at each step

### Escape Valves
- **Time limits**: Auto-stop after specified duration
- **Change limits**: Maximum files/lines modified per session
- **Test gates**: All tests must pass before proceeding
- **Human checkpoints**: Mandatory reviews at key milestones
- **Emergency stop**: Keyboard interrupt handling

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic YOLO Mode
- Single task automation with safety checks
- Dry-run capability
- Basic anomaly detection

### Phase 2: Batch Processing
- Multiple task execution
- Dependency resolution
- Progress checkpointing

### Phase 3: Intelligent Automation
- Smart task selection
- Risk assessment
- Adaptive behavior based on success rates

## Technical Approach

### Command Structure
```bash
./scripts/tasks.sh yolo [options] [filters]

Options:
  --dry-run                  Show actions without executing
  --max-tasks N             Limit number of tasks to process
  --max-files N             Limit files modified per task
  --timeout SECONDS         Stop after time limit
  --component NAME          Filter by component
  --priority LEVEL          Filter by priority level
  --checkpoint-interval N   Save state every N operations
  --no-auto-commit         Disable auto-commit in YOLO mode

Filters:
  --network                 Only network-related tasks
  --storage                 Only storage-related tasks
  --agent                   Only agent-related tasks
  --docs                    Only documentation tasks
```

### Safety Mechanisms
1. **Pre-flight checks**: System state validation
2. **Progress tracking**: Detailed logging of all operations
3. **Test validation**: Automated testing after each change
4. **Rollback points**: Git commits for easy recovery
5. **Anomaly detection**: Pattern recognition for unusual behavior

### Risk Mitigation
- Start with low-risk tasks (documentation, tests)
- Gradual expansion to core implementation
- Human oversight for critical components
- Automated backup creation
- Conservative error handling

## Success Metrics
- Tasks completed per hour
- Success rate (tests passing)
- Rollback frequency
- Time to recovery from errors
- Code quality maintenance

## Future Enhancements
- Machine learning for task difficulty estimation
- Predictive anomaly detection
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Multi-project support
- Collaborative YOLO sessions
