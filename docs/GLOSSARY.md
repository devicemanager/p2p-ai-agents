## Core Terminology

### Project Names

- **P2P AI Agents** - The official full project name (use in formal documentation)
- **p2p-ai-agents** - Repository name and package identifier (use in code and file references)
- **Agent System** - Acceptable short reference when context is clear

### Network Terminology

- **Network Protocol** - The standardized communication rules between agents
- **Network Implementation** - The actual code implementation of network protocols
- **Peer Discovery** - The process of finding and connecting to other agents
- **Network Manager** - The component responsible for managing network operations

### Task & Processing Terminology

- **Task Processing** - The standard term for handling computational tasks (preferred)
- **Task Management** - Use only when referring to the scheduling/orchestration aspects
- **Task Distribution** - The process of distributing tasks across the network
- **Task Execution** - The actual computational work performed by agents

### Agent Terminology

- **Agent** - A single instance of the P2P AI system
- **Peer Agent** - Another agent in the network (synonym: peer)
- **Agent Node** - The computational entity running an agent instance
- **Agent Identity** - The cryptographic identity of an agent

### Implementation Terminology

- **Core Implementation** - The fundamental system components
- **Network Layer** - The networking subsystem
- **Storage Layer** - The data persistence subsystem
- **Security Layer** - The security and authentication subsystem

### Security Terminology

- **Authentication** - Verifying agent identity
- **Authorization** - Controlling access to resources
- **Encryption** - Data protection in transit and at rest
- **Security Model** - The overall security architecture

### Documentation Terminology

- **Implementation Guide** - Technical implementation documentation
- **User Guide** - End-user focused documentation
- **Architecture Documentation** - High-level system design documentation
- **API Reference** - Programming interface documentation

## Deprecated Terms

Please avoid using these terms and replace with the preferred alternatives:

| Deprecated | Preferred | Context |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| "P2P AI Agents" | "P2P AI Agents" | Full project name |
| "P2P AI Agents" | "P2P AI Agents" | Capitalization consistency |
| "Task Management" | "Task Processing" | When referring to computational work |
| "Network Implementation" | "Network Layer" | When referring to architecture |
| "Security Implementation" | "Security Architecture" | When referring to design |

## Abbreviations

### Accepted Abbreviations

- **P2P** - Peer-to-Peer
- **AI** - Artificial Intelligence
- **API** - Application Programming Interface
- **DHT** - Distributed Hash Table
- **mDNS** - Multicast DNS
- **TLS** - Transport Layer Security

### Project-Specific Abbreviations

- **NAL** - Network Abstraction Layer
- **TAL** - Task Abstraction Layer
- **SAL** - Storage Abstraction Layer

## Usage Guidelines

### In Documentation
1. **First Reference**: Use the full term, followed by abbreviation in parentheses
   - Example: "Distributed Hash Table (DHT)"
2. **Subsequent References**: Use the abbreviation
3. **Formal Documentation**: Always use "P2P AI Agents" for the project name
4. **Code Comments**: Use abbreviated forms where appropriate

### In Code
1. **Variable Names**: Use clear, descriptive names based on this glossary
2. **Function Names**: Follow the terminology patterns defined here
3. **Module Names**: Align with the architectural terminology

### In Commit Messages
1. Use consistent terminology from this glossary
2. Prefer abbreviated forms for brevity while maintaining clarity

## Validation

Use this checklist to validate terminology usage:

- [ ] Project name consistently uses "P2P AI Agents"
- [ ] Network-related terms use "Network Protocol" vs "Network Implementation" appropriately
- [ ] Task-related terms prefer "Task Processing" over "Task Management"
- [ ] Security terms use "Security Architecture" for design, "Security Layer" for implementation
- [ ] Abbreviations are defined on first use
- [ ] Deprecated terms are not used
