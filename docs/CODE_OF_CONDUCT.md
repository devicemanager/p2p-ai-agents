- Respect different time zones and availability in global collaborations

### Conflict Resolution

- Address conflicts directly and respectfully with the involved parties first

- Escalate to community moderators when direct resolution isn't possible

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

### Technical Community Expectations

As a technical project involving distributed systems and AI, we have additional expectations:

- **Security Responsibility**: Contributors must not intentionally introduce security vulnerabilities
- **Data Privacy**: Respect user privacy and data protection principles in all contributions
- **Reliable Contributions**: Test code thoroughly and ensure contributions work as documented
- **Transparent Communication**: Be honest about limitations, bugs, and potential issues
- **Collaborative Development**: Work openly and share knowledge to benefit the entire community

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

- **Email**: [conduct@p2p-agent.org](mailto:conduct@p2p-agent.org)
- **Discord**: Direct message to @Moderator role
- **Anonymous Form**: [Report form link]

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: Reports will be acknowledged within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: The moderation team will investigate the reported behavior
3. **Decision**: Appropriate action will be determined based on the severity and context
4. **Communication**: The outcome will be communicated to relevant parties
