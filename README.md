## Vision

This project aims to democratize AI by building a distributed, peer-to-peer (P2P) network of lightweight AI agents. Anyone can contribute their idle compute (PC, server, Raspberry Pi, etc.) to help process, chunk, and retrieve data—reducing the need for centralized, energy-intensive datacenters and making AI accessible to all.

**🌟 Join the movement to build a sustainable, decentralized AI future!**

## Why P2P AI Agents?

### 🌱 **Sustainability**
- **Energy Efficient**: Utilize existing, underutilized hardware instead of building new energy-intensive datacenters
- **Carbon Footprint**: Reduce CO2 emissions by leveraging distributed computing resources
- **Renewable Integration**: Smart scheduling to use renewable energy when available

### 🔒 **Privacy & Security**
- **Data Sovereignty**: Data stays local wherever possible, with federated and secure processing
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All communications are cryptographically secured
- **Zero-Knowledge Processing**: Agents can process data without accessing raw content

### 🌐 **Resilience & Decentralization**
- **No Single Point of Failure**: Network grows stronger as more people join
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic failover and task redistribution
- **Censorship Resistance**: Decentralized architecture prevents shutdown

### 🤝 **Accessibility & Inclusion**
- **Anyone Can Participate**: From Raspberry Pi to high-end servers
- **Economic Incentives**: Contributors can earn rewards for sharing resources
- **Global Collaboration**: Connect AI enthusiasts worldwide

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What hardware do I need to run an agent?**
A: Any device with Python 3.8+, 2GB RAM, and internet connection. Raspberry Pi 4, laptops, desktops, and servers all work great.

**Q: Is my data safe and private?**
A: Yes! Data processing uses encryption, federated approaches, and agents never store raw data unnecessarily. You control what data your agent processes.

**Q: How do I earn rewards for contributing compute?**
A: The reputation system tracks your contributions. Future versions will integrate with blockchain-based incentive mechanisms.

**Q: Can I run multiple agents?**
A: Absolutely! You can run different types of agents (processing, storage, etc.) on the same machine or across multiple devices.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What AI tasks are supported?**
A: Currently: text chunking, embeddings, similarity search, and basic NLP. We're adding image processing, speech recognition, and more.

**Q: How does the P2P network handle failures?**
A: Agents use heartbeat monitoring, automatic failover, and task redistribution. The network is designed to be resilient to node failures.

**Q: Can I develop custom agents?**
A: Yes! The plugin architecture allows custom agent types. See the [Developer Guide](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for details.

**Q: What about network security?**
A: All communications use encryption, agents authenticate with cryptographic signatures, and we implement reputation-based trust.

## MVP Peer-to-Peer Considerations

- **Security & Authentication:** Agents use cryptographic keypairs for identity and sign all messages. Communication is encrypted.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Agents detect failures and reassign or retry tasks as needed.
- **Message/Task Format:** All agent messages use a simple JSON structure with type, task_id, payload, sender_id, and signature fields.
- **Network Bootstrap:** New agents join via a known bootstrap node or multicast discovery, then find more peers.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Agents log key events and errors for transparency and debugging.

## 📏 500-Line Limit Policy

**P2P Agent enforces a strict 500-line maximum for all files** to ensure compatibility with small language models and resource-constrained environments.

### Why 500 Lines?

- **🤖 AI Model Compatibility**: Small models can process files under 500 lines efficiently
- **💻 Resource Efficiency**: Lower memory footprint and faster processing
- **👥 Developer Experience**: Easier code review and better maintainability
- **🔄 Modularity**: Forces good architectural decisions and separation of concerns

### Enforcement

- **Automated checks** in pre-commit hooks and CI/CD
- **Code review requirements** for all pull requests
- **Refactoring triggers** when files approach 400 lines
- **Documentation splits** with table of contents approach

See the complete **[500-Line Limit Policy](docs/500_LINE_LIMIT_POLICY.md)** for detailed guidelines and implementation strategies.
