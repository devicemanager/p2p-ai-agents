> **⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS - MAJOR VISION TRANSFORMATION**
> 
> **January 2026 Update**: This project is undergoing a strategic transformation from a distributed ML compute network to a **Distributed Expert System** architecture.
> 
> **New Vision**: Building a peer-to-peer network where domain experts contribute knowledge and reasoning rules, enabling transparent, explainable decision support across multiple domains. Unlike black-box AI, our system shows WHY and HOW it reaches conclusions.
> 
> **Recent Major Updates:**
> - ✅ **Vision Transformation**: Pivoting to expert system architecture (January 2026)
> - ✅ **Core Architecture**: Complete dependency injection, event system, service registry, and access control
> - ✅ **Security Framework**: RBAC authentication and authorization with pluggable providers
> - ✅ **P2P Foundation**: libp2p networking with peer discovery and secure messaging
> - ✅ **Structured Logging**: JSON logging with correlation IDs for distributed tracing
> - 🔲 **Inference Engine**: Rule-based reasoning system (in development)
> - 🔲 **Knowledge Base**: Expert knowledge repository (in development)
> 
> We welcome contributions, especially from domain experts interested in democratizing knowledge!

## Vision

**"Distributed Expert Intelligence Network: Peer-to-Peer Knowledge, Reasoning & Transparent Decision-Making"**

### What We're Building

This project transforms how expert knowledge is shared and applied by creating a decentralized network of expert nodes that collaboratively solve complex domain-specific problems through **transparent rule-based reasoning**.

**Key Differentiators:**
- 🧠 **Expert Knowledge, Not Just Compute**: Domain experts contribute specialized reasoning rules and knowledge
- 🔍 **Transparent Reasoning**: Every conclusion shows its reasoning path - no black boxes
- 🌐 **Decentralized Collaboration**: Multiple experts can consult on complex problems simultaneously
- ✅ **Explainable by Design**: Built-in "why" and "how" explanations for all decisions
- 🔐 **Trustworthy & Auditable**: Full reasoning traces for compliance and verification

**Target Use Cases:**
- ⚖️ Legal document analysis and case research
- 💰 Financial risk assessment and compliance
- 🔧 Technical troubleshooting and support
- 🎓 Intelligent tutoring and education

**🌟 Join us in democratizing expert knowledge and making AI reasoning transparent!**

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

**Expert System Layer (New - In Development):**
- **Inference Engine**: Forward/backward chaining reasoning
- **Knowledge Base**: Domain-specific rules and facts
- **Expert Registry**: Credential verification and expertise matching
- **Query Router**: Intelligent routing to appropriate experts
- **Explanation Generator**: Transparent reasoning traces

**P2P Foundation (Complete):**
- **Network Layer**: libp2p-based peer discovery and messaging
- **Identity System**: Ed25519 cryptographic identity for nodes
- **Security**: RBAC authentication and authorization
- **Storage**: Pluggable storage backends (local, Redis, Supabase)

**Infrastructure (Complete):**
- **Event System**: Async event-driven architecture
- **Service Registry**: Dependency injection container
- **Observability**: Structured logging, metrics, tracing
- **CLI Tools**: Node management and monitoring

### How It Works

**Example: Technical Code Review Assistant**

```
1. Query Submission → "Review this Rust async code for potential deadlocks"
2. Query Router → Identifies concurrent programming domain
3. Expert Selection → Finds Rust/async programming expert nodes
4. Inference Engine → Applies concurrency safety rules and patterns
5. Multi-Expert Consultation → Multiple experts review different aspects
6. Result + Explanation → "Potential deadlock detected at line 42 because..."
   └─ Reasoning Trace: Shows which rules triggered and why
   └─ Evidence: Code patterns matched, similar issues database
   └─ Confidence: 85% (based on rule certainty and expert consensus)
```

**Example Flow:**
```rust
// Submit query
let query = Query::new()
    .domain("rust-concurrency")
    .code(source_code)
    .question("Are there potential race conditions?");

// Network routes to qualified experts
let experts = network.find_experts(&query).await?;

// Each expert applies their knowledge base
let reviews = experts.review_in_parallel(query).await?;

// Synthesize results with full reasoning traces
let result = synthesize_with_explanations(reviews)?;

println!("Found {} potential issues", result.issues.len());
for issue in result.issues {
    println!("  - {}: {}", issue.severity, issue.description);
    println!("    Why: {}", issue.reasoning);
    println!("    Fix: {}", issue.suggested_fix);
}
```
