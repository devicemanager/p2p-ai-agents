> **‚ö†Ô∏è WORK IN PROGRESS DISCLAIMER**
> 
> This project is currently in early development and serves as a foundational boilerplate for building distributed peer-to-peer AI agents. The current implementation provides basic structure and components, but many features are still being developed. This is not yet ready for production use.
> 
> We welcome contributions and feedback as we work toward a fully functional system!

## Vision

This project aims to democratize AI by building a distributed, peer-to-peer (P2P) network of lightweight AI agents. Anyone can contribute their idle compute (PC, server, Raspberry Pi, etc.) to help process, chunk, and retrieve data‚Äîreducing the need for centralized, energy-intensive datacenters and making AI accessible to all.

**üåü Join the movement to build a sustainable, decentralized AI future!**
