# High Level Design: Distributed Peer-to-Peer AI Agents

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the architecture, design options, and key components for building a distributed, peer-to-peer (P2P) network of lightweight AI agents. The goal is to enable collaborative AI processing using underutilized hardware, with a focus on sustainability, privacy, and resilience.

## 2. Core Components
- **Agent Core:** Manages local tasks, communication, and resource monitoring. Agents may be general-purpose or specialized for specific tasks (e.g., NLP, vectorization, storage, aggregation).
- **Specialized Agents:** Some agents are optimized for particular functions (e.g., chunking, vector search, federated learning, or data storage). These agents can advertise their capabilities and may be distributed for high availability and load balancing. Specialized agents can earn reputation or 'karma' for reliable contributions, incentivizing participation and quality.
- **Agent Discovery & Capability Registry:** The network supports discovery of agents and their advertised capabilities using the agent protocol. A distributed database (e.g., DHT or gossip-based registry) maintains metadata about available agents, their specializations, and reputation scores. This enables dynamic routing of tasks to the most suitable agents and supports redundancy for critical services.
- **P2P Networking Layer:** Handles peer discovery, secure communication, and task distribution.
- **Task Queue & Scheduler:** Organizes incoming/outgoing tasks and schedules them based on resource availability and agent specialization.
- **Chunking/NLP Module:** Splits data into manageable pieces and performs initial processing.
- **Vectorization/Embedding Module:** Converts data chunks into vector representations for efficient retrieval.
- **Result Aggregation:** Collects and combines results from local and remote agents.
- **Storage Layer:** Manages local and shared storage of data chunks and metadata.

## 3. Design Options
### A. Networking & Communication
- **Option 1: libp2p (Python/Go/JS)**
  - Pros: Mature, cross-platform, supports NAT traversal, encryption, peer discovery.
  - Cons: Adds dependency, learning curve.
- **Option 2: Custom WebSocket/HTTP**
  - Pros: Simpler, easier to debug, fewer dependencies.
  - Cons: Less robust, harder to scale, NAT/firewall issues.
- **Option 3: IPFS PubSub**
  - Pros: Decentralized, content-addressed, integrates with IPFS storage.
  - Cons: Overhead, dependency on IPFS.

### B. Task Distribution & Scheduling
- **Option 1: Centralized Coordinator (Bootstrap Phase Only)**
  - Pros: Easier to implement, good for MVP.
  - Cons: Single point of failure, not fully decentralized.
- **Option 2: Fully Decentralized (Gossip, DHT, or PubSub)**
  - Pros: No single point of failure, scalable.
  - Cons: More complex, requires robust protocol.

### C. Data Storage
- **Option 1: Local Filesystem**
  - Pros: Simple, fast, no extra dependencies.
  - Cons: No sharing between peers, limited redundancy.
- **Option 2: IPFS or Similar Distributed Storage**
  - Pros: Decentralized, content-addressed, easy sharing.
  - Cons: Overhead, dependency on IPFS.

### D. AI Processing
- **Option 1: Use Existing Python Libraries (spaCy, NLTK, transformers, etc.)**
  - Pros: Fast to prototype, well-supported.
  - Cons: May require more resources, dependency management.
- **Option 2: Custom Lightweight Models**
  - Pros: Optimized for edge devices, lower resource usage.
  - Cons: More development effort.

## 4. Recommended MVP Path
- Use Python for agent core and processing modules.
- Use libp2p (via py-libp2p or go-libp2p with Python bindings) for networking.
- Start with local filesystem for storage, add IPFS later.
- Use spaCy or similar for NLP/chunking, sentence-transformers for vectorization.
- Implement a simple decentralized task queue using libp2p PubSub.

## 5. Next Steps
1. Define agent core API and interfaces.
2. Prototype P2P networking (libp2p or fallback to WebSocket).
3. Implement local task queue and chunking module.
4. Add basic vectorization and result aggregation.
5. Test with two or more agents on a local network.
6. Expand to distributed storage and more advanced scheduling.

## 6. Open Questions
- How to incentivize participation?
- How to handle malicious or unreliable peers?
- What are the minimum hardware/software requirements?
- How to support federated learning securely?

## 7. Distributed Trust Model
Establishing trust in a decentralized, peer-to-peer network is a major challenge. While technical solutions exist, no model is perfectâ€”especially when sensitive data or valuable assets are involved.

**Key Approaches:**
- **Reputation Systems:** Peers build a reputation over time based on successful task completion and feedback (see [1]).
- **Cryptographic Proofs:** Use digital signatures and verifiable computation to ensure data integrity and authenticity (see [2]).
- **Quorum/Consensus:** Require agreement from multiple independent peers before accepting results or transactions.
- **Sandboxing & Resource Limits:** Limit the scope and impact of untrusted code or data.

**Open Questions:**
- How to prevent Sybil attacks (fake identities)?
- How to balance privacy with accountability?
- What incentives/disincentives are effective for honest participation?

## 8. Additional MVP Considerations

- **Security & Authentication:**
  - Each agent generates or is assigned a unique cryptographic keypair (e.g., Ed25519).
  - Agents authenticate messages using digital signatures; public keys serve as agent identities.
  - All communication is encrypted (e.g., TLS or libp2p's built-in encryption).

- **Fault Tolerance & Recovery:**
  - Agents periodically send heartbeat messages to peers.
  - If a peer fails or disconnects, its tasks are re-assigned by the scheduler.
  - Incomplete or failed tasks are retried or redistributed.

- **Message/Task Format:**
  - Tasks and messages are exchanged as JSON objects with required fields:
    - `type` (e.g., 'chunk', 'vectorize', 'result')
    - `task_id`
    - `payload` (task-specific data)
    - `sender_id`, `signature`

- **Network Bootstrap:**
  - New agents join the network by connecting to a known bootstrap node or using multicast discovery.
  - After joining, agents discover additional peers via the agent protocol.

- **Monitoring & Logging:**
  - Agents log key events: peer join/leave, task received/completed, errors.
  - Minimal monitoring dashboard or CLI output for debugging and transparency.
