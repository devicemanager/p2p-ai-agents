## 3. Security Architecture

### 3.1 Identity and Authentication

**Cryptographic Identity**
- Each agent generates Ed25519 keypair for identity
- Public key serves as permanent agent identifier
- Private key for message signing and authentication

**Multi-Factor Authentication**
- Primary: Cryptographic signatures
- Secondary: Reputation scores and peer vouching
- Optional: Hardware security modules (HSM) for high-value agents

### 3.2 Communication Security

**Transport Layer Security**
- All communications encrypted using TLS 1.3 or libp2p security
- Perfect forward secrecy with ephemeral key exchange
- Certificate pinning for known peers

**Message Authentication**
- Every message signed with sender's private key
- Replay attack prevention using timestamps and nonces
- Message integrity verification using HMAC

### 3.3 Network Security

**DDoS Protection**
- Rate limiting on message processing
- Reputation-based filtering of suspicious peers
- Distributed load balancing across network

**Sybil Attack Prevention**
- Proof-of-work requirements for new agent registration
- Social verification through existing peer networks
- Resource commitment validation

### 3.4 Data Protection

**Privacy-Preserving Processing**
- Differential privacy for sensitive data operations
- Homomorphic encryption for computation on encrypted data
- Secure multi-party computation for collaborative learning

**Data Minimization**
- Process only necessary data portions
- Automatic data deletion after task completion
- User-controlled data retention policies

## 4. Performance and Scalability

## 6. Open Questions
- How to incentivize participation?
- How to handle malicious or unreliable peers?
- What are the minimum hardware/software requirements?
- How to support federated learning securely?

## 7. Distributed Trust Model
Establishing trust in a decentralized, peer-to-peer network is a major challenge. While technical solutions exist, no model is perfectâ€”especially when sensitive data or valuable assets are involved.

**Key Approaches:**
- **Reputation Systems:** Peers build a reputation over time based on successful task completion and feedback (see [1]).
- **Cryptographic Proofs:** Use digital signatures and verifiable computation to ensure data integrity and authenticity (see [2]).
- **Quorum/Consensus:** Require agreement from multiple independent peers before accepting results or transactions.
- **Sandboxing & Resource Limits:** Limit the scope and impact of untrusted code or data.

**Open Questions:**
- How to prevent Sybil attacks (fake identities)?
- How to balance privacy with accountability?
- What incentives/disincentives are effective for honest participation?

## 8. Additional MVP Considerations

- **Security & Authentication:**
  - Each agent generates or is assigned a unique cryptographic keypair (e.g., Ed25519).
  - Agents authenticate messages using digital signatures; public keys serve as agent identities.
  - All communication is encrypted (e.g., TLS or libp2p's built-in encryption).

- **Fault Tolerance & Recovery:**
  - Agents periodically send heartbeat messages to peers.
  - If a peer fails or disconnects, its tasks are re-assigned by the scheduler.
  - Incomplete or failed tasks are retried or redistributed.

- **Message/Task Format:**
  - Tasks and messages are exchanged as JSON objects with required fields:
    - `type` (e.g., 'chunk', 'vectorize', 'result')
    - `task_id`
    - `payload` (task-specific data)
    - `sender_id`, `signature`

- **Network Bootstrap:**
  - New agents join the network by connecting to a known bootstrap node or using multicast discovery.
  - After joining, agents discover additional peers via the agent protocol.

- **Monitoring & Logging:**
  - Agents log key events: peer join/leave, task received/completed, errors.
  - Minimal monitoring dashboard or CLI output for debugging and transparency.
