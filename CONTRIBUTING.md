## Code Standards

### Python Code Style

- **PEP 8** compliance (enforced by `black` and `flake8`)
- **Type hints** required for all public functions
- **Docstrings** required for all public classes and functions
- **Maximum line length**: 100 characters

### Code Quality Tools

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code
black .
isort .

# Lint code
flake8
pylint p2p_ai_agents/

# Type checking
mypy p2p_ai_agents/

# Security scanning
bandit -r p2p_ai_agents/
```

### Documentation Standards

- **Docstring format**: Google style
- **API documentation**: Auto-generated from docstrings
- **Markdown linting**: Using `markdownlint`
- **Link checking**: Automated verification of external links

## Testing Requirements

### Test Categories

**Unit Tests**
- Individual function and class testing
- Mocked external dependencies
- Fast execution (< 1 second per test)

**Integration Tests**
- Multi-component interaction testing
- Real P2P network communication
- Database and storage testing

**End-to-End Tests**
- Full workflow testing
- Multi-agent scenarios
- Performance validation

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=p2p_ai_agents

# Run specific test category
pytest tests/unit/
pytest tests/integration/
pytest tests/e2e/

# Run performance tests
pytest tests/performance/ --benchmark-only
```

### Test Requirements

- **Minimum coverage**: 80% for new code
- **All tests must pass** on supported Python versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
- **Performance tests** must not regress by > 10%

## üìè File Size Requirements

### 500-Line Limit Policy

**All files in P2P AI Agents must not exceed 500 lines.** This includes:

- **Source code files** (.py, .js, .ts, etc.)
- **Documentation files** (.md, .rst, .txt)
- **Configuration files** (.yaml, .toml, .json)
- **Scripts and tools** (.sh, .bat, etc.)

### Rationale

- **Small model compatibility**: AI assistants can process entire files efficiently
- **Resource efficiency**: Lower memory usage on development machines
- **Better maintainability**: Forced modularization improves code quality
- **Easier code review**: Manageable file sizes for human reviewers

### Implementation

When a file approaches 400 lines:

1. **Create an issue** to track the refactoring need
2. **Identify logical break points** for splitting
3. **Extract modules/sections** into separate files
4. **Update imports/references** accordingly
5. **Maintain comprehensive tests** for refactored code

For documentation files:
1. **Create a table of contents** in the main file
2. **Split content** into numbered sub-files
3. **Link between sections** for navigation
4. **Update cross-references** in other documents

### Automated Enforcement

```bash
# Pre-commit hook checks file sizes
pre-commit run --all-files

# Manual check for oversized files
find . -name "*.py" -o -name "*.md" | xargs wc -l | awk '$1 > 500'
```

See **[500-Line Limit Policy](docs/500_LINE_LIMIT_POLICY.md)** for complete guidelines.

*Note: This contributing guide is continuously updated. Check the [documentation](https://p2p-agent.readthedocs.io/) for the latest contribution guidelines.*
